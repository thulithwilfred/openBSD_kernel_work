.Nd pfexec policy daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pfexecd
.Op Fl ft
.Op Fl c Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon which makes policy decisions about whether to allow privilege
escalation by users of the
.Xr pfexec 1
tool and the
.Xr pfexecve 2
system call.
.Pp
Its main purpose is to listen for requests from the kernel, which contain
credential information about the process and user requesting escalation, and
then apply the policy specified in its configuration file,
.Xr pfexecd.conf 5 .
.Pp
When escalation is allowed by policy,
.Nm
informs the kernel of the final credentials to set for the process, including
the
.Em UID ,
.Em GID ,
.Em groups ,
and
.Em environment variables
that the new process should run with.
.Pp
When escalation is denied,
.Nm
specifies the
.Xr errno 2
error code value to be returned by
.Xr pfexecve 2 .
